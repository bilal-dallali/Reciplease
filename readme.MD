# How to use the application Reciplease
- Add a Config.xconfig file at the root of the project to add your environment variable
- Create a edamam account to have access to the API, create an appId and an apiKey
- Add your key and your id like this
  - API_KEY=your_api_key
  - API_ID=your_api_id
- Since the config.xconfig file is ignored by git it needs to be kept that way, never upload your api keys on a public repository
